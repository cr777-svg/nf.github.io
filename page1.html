Besides the very high protein content (36.5 g per 100
g or 3.5 oz), soybeans contain a lot of fiber and are
rich in calcium and magnesium. When used as a
substitute for meat, which it does well because of its&nbsp; protein profile, a serving of soybeans can save you
fat, especially saturated fat. Snack on dry-roasted&nbsp; soybeans, toss shelled edamame into soups, and slip
a spoonful of silken tofu into your morning smoothie.
Liquid soy also makes a good meal replacement: A
study from the Journal of the American College of&nbsp; Nutrition found that overweight subjects who drank a
soy milk-based meal replacement lost more weight
than those who consumed a traditional dairy-based
diet drink.&nbsp;<br></p>

good dose of healthy omega-3 fatty acids (this type
of fat helps make your metabolism more efficient,
according to "Fitness" magazine). Salmon may help
boost your metabolism and keep you feeling full.
An Australian study showed that overweight people
who ate fish daily improved their glucose - insulin
response. Translated, this means that seafood
may help slow digestion and prevent cravings. If
that doesn't hook you, consider this: Seafood is an
excellent source of abs-friendly protein. Eat about 4
oz. of salmon, twice a week, recommends "Fitness"
magazine. If you don't like fish, another option for
getting omega-3 fatty acid is eating flaxseed and
walnuts. Several recent studies have found that
salmon contains small bioactive protein molecules
(called bioactive peptides) that may provide special
support for joint cartilage, insulin effectiveness, and
control of inflammation in the digestive tract.

Quinoa is gluten-free, easy to prepare and extremely versatile. You can use quinoa anywhere you'd typically use rice. It's great used in casseroles and stir fry, mixed with beans, or simply topped with tofu and vegetables. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United&nbsp; Nations (FAO) has officially declared that the year&nbsp; 2013 be recognized as "The International Year of the Quinoa." It has now been singled out by the FAO as&nbsp; a food with "high nutritive value," and impressive biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>

Salty food, like potato chips and fast foods, may cause bloating&nbsp; of your tummy, because your body will retain water in your midsection and accumulate it outside of cells. Avocado contains potassium, which helps bring the water back into the cells. Dieters who consumed monounsaturated fats lost more stomach bulge than those eating the same number of calories but Less of the fats, a study in the journal Diabetes Care finds. And a study in the journal Obesity reveals

They're a Low GI (glycaemic index) food, which means they keep your blood-sugar (and energy) levels nice and steady. A 2009 study at the University of Michigan fed rats a blueberry-enriched powder for 90 days. After the 90 days, the rats who received the powder, which accounted for 2 percent of their diet, had less abdominal fat and improved fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, which measures how your body uses glucose for energy. The more fiber you eat experts say that it's best to get between 25 and 35 grams every day - the fewer calories you absorb from all the other stuff you put in your mouth. Thať's because fiber traps food particles and shuttles them out of your system before they're fully digested.&nbsp;</p>

They contain a perfect balance of essential amino acids which are protein building blocks responsible for building everything in your body - from muscle fibers to brain chemicals. In a randomized controlled trial, 160 overweight or obese men and women were divided into 2 groups, one of which ate a breakfast including 2 eggs, while the other consumed a bagel breakfast supplying the same amount of calories and weight mass (an important control factor in satiety and weight loss studies). Participants ate their assigned breakfast at least 5 days a week for 8 weeks as part of a low-fat diet with a 1,000 calorie deficit. Compared to those on the bagel breakfast, egg eaters had an 83% greater decrease in waist circumference.

Obesity suggests that people who get their calcium
mostly from yogurts lose more weight around their
midsection. The probiotic bacteria found in yogurts
keep your digestive system healthy, which translates
to less bloating and constipation, which in turn
makes you belly flatter. Eat 18 ounces a day and you
can drop a jeans size. People who ate that much
in conjunction with cutting their total calories - lost 22 percent more weight and 81 percent more belly
fat than dieters who skipped the snack, according to
research from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.&nbsp;<br></p>

reduce cravings, and fight obesity. Start your
mornings with a handful of small almonds (at least
6). They will help your body to burn fat and help you
on your way to a flat stomach. These delicious and
versatile nuts contain filling protein and fiber, not to
mention vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant. They're
<br>also a good source of magnesium, a mineral your
body must have in order to produce energy, build and
maintain muscle tissue, and regulate blood sugar. "A
stable blood-sugar level helps prevent cravings that
can lead to overeating and weight gain," says David
Katz, MD, a professor at the Yale University School of
Medicine.

<br>Spinach is a great source of vitamins and minerals (calcium, beta-carotene, vitamin C and magnesium) and with only 7 calories per cup it is a very low-calorie food. Calcium is known to help muscles to contact so it's a great pre-workout food. You could eat a whole bag and mot even put a dent in your daily calories. So put it in whatever. Omelets, salads, smoothies, wraps, if you can put spinach in it (and not have it be disgusting) do it.&nbsp;</p>

It will help your body to increase its metabolism and it will reduce your daily caloric intake. By drinking eight cups of chilled water per day your body will spend 70 calories more than it would otherwise. Also, by drinking water instead of high-sugar drinks, you will cut hundreds of extra calories per day!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
